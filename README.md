# Stepping away from the compiler and interpreting your c/c++ & assembly instead:

Hello, and welcome to the repo for interpreting c/c++ & assembly and binding them to function handles or python functions & vise versa.

For an example of what your code should look like to model off of, look into main.py & main1.py

# Isn't c/c++ normally compiled down?

Ordinarally, yes. Pridominantly 90% of c/c++ applications get compiled down, including bootloaders, kernels, and drivers. However, most code doesn't need to be compiled. It just has to run.

Most applications get harder to use on multiple OSes because when it was initially compiled it was compiled.
